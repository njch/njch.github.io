# njch.github.com
concept art for what else the internet could look like

Imaginative miraculously crafty foam of formulation seeking growth.
An cosmology of code space with style! Full of patterns, foldings
leaving you to max out on self. Embryo of possible beingness embeds
over names and fractions (a vector's sphere/index) of 1-9. Patterns.
Leading to coding/design where you craft on the ends of times like
bracken and it networks away sanely. It's new code style! Patterns.

See http://github.com/st3vil/stylehouse for the whole self of it.

njch code falls out of that regularly, its an indifferent display
unit that receives waves from the self, which must be over the
network somewhere.

It's a javascript tape machine for stylehouse waves.

The *.c and *.sc in W/ are not stylehouse waves (and their appliances
are not very stylehousey at the moment) but you should be able to
change those links and get your stuff in there.

* Must be served via web due to ajax requests to get W/* things.
* Pics for art mash cannot be on remote hosts (see CORS, or dont)
* Try github hosting but don't push your luck with traffic/space.
* Open an issue on stylehouse, get it fixed, improve the world.

Stylehouse is to invent everything. Njch is to televise relevant
happening playthings and evolve into more or itself.
