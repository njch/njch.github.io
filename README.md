concept art for what else the internet could look like

Imaginative miraculously crafty foam of formulation seeking growth.
An cosmology with code space with style! Full of patterns, folds
leaving you to max out on self. Embryo of possible beingness embeds
over names and fractions (a vector's sphere/index) of 1-9. Patterns.
Leading to coding/design where you craft on the ends of times like
bracken and it networks away sanely. It's new code style! Patterns.

See http://github.com/st3vil/stylehouse for the code.
